Titan Panel [Heart of Azeroth]
==================

## Description
A very simple plugin to Titan Panel that tracks information regarding the Heart of Azeroth Artifact in the Battle for Azeroth expansion.

## What it tracks
* Power Level
* Current Artifact Power
* Artifact Power to get to the next level
* How much Artifact Power gained in that session (tooltip).

## Possible issues
Updating the AP gained in a session after an increase in the Power Level may not work. My main needs about 15000 AP to get to the next level so I'm currently working through quests on an alt to test my latest fix.

## Dependencies
* Titan Panel

## Features I'd like to add
* Set text color
* Display level requirments for next Azerite trait for each piece of Azerite Armor in tooltip
* Tracking for the rate of artifact power gain to provide an estimate on how much time needed to gain a level
